This application run two basic loops, Admin loop and Customer loop.

Run first Customer loop and create a customer.

Perform some actions with the customer, add funds, check your balance and buy some pets. (check if discount is applied)

You can reset the application, from the app menu, and create as much customers as you want. (One by one)

Once you have some customers and you have reset the application from the app menu (dont kill the app), 
you can run the application as an admin. 

The admin loop has just two simple things two show, list of customers previously created and the 
popularity of the pets. (That's why to create customers and buy pets with them are a must previous step,
otherwise the admin loop will have nothing to show.)


I hope yoou like what I have done. I have had no time to extend and implement more thigns to this project.
The coursework is really demanding for my level and it is taking so much time. There are 3 more modules and 3 more projects. 
I will try to create a better app this summer inspired in this one. Thank you for everything. 

Have a nice one.

Daniel
